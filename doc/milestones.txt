--- Milestone 0.8
Goal: The NISQL should succesfully connect to database, run the query, and dump the result in any human-readable format.
- Decide on format for command-line arguments. And how to decrypt them?
- Write a command-line parser. Should it be a direct parser or should we use some library or standard functions?
- Decide on how to work with ODBC - by direct calls, or by C++ wrapper. If a wrapper, which one?
- Write a code to decipher "query" command-line argument.
- Write a code to connect to database, and execute the actual query.
- Design an abstract class for data printers.
- Use the abstract class as a parent for simplies of printers (txt - fixed width format)
- Test various queries with default settings of the printer.


--- Milestone 1.0
Goal: The NISQL should do all stuff described in proposal and be ready for deployment.
- Write a decryptor for printer's parameters.
- Write CSV printer, and test it
- Write XML printer, and test it
- Write JSON printer, and test it

--- Milestone 1.2
Goal: Minor improvements of the application.
- Remember commonly used formats to which datasets can be 'printed'.
- Write (ouselves or by using pre-existing libraries) printers into those formats.


--- Milestone 2.0
Goal: Make it shine
- Design a report description language (probably band-style). Can use for inspiration SRD format used by PowerBuilder.
- Make a groff or tex printer based on the report description.
- Wait for inspiration or user suggestions for other improvements.
