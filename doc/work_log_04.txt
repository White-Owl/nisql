------------- Day 04
 And the question of the day: do we actually need special classes for different
printers? The task is to print resultset. The formatting is controlled by a
global variable, the default output file name is also global variable. So all
we actually need is a set of functions which receive a resultset and run with
it...
 Using this approach, we would need a format_options decription function. With
a target of map<string,string>, and a set of printing functions, which can be
chosen at runtime. And in this case we do not need a format_options variable
at all.
 So on today's plate: write a parser from a format "KEY1=VAL1;KEY2=VAL2" into
map<string,string>.  Done.
 The new questions is: do we need it to be case sensitive or insesitive?
 We probably want to convert boolean flags (like "print column name or not") in
a format HDR=ON, HDR=OFF. But what about HDR=YES? or HDR=TRUE?

 The second piece of today's work is print_result_as_txt()... and done!

 Milstone 0.8 - is reached.

./nisql "DSN=mysql1;UID=jim;PWD=123" student out.txt -v -f"HDR=ON"
./nisql "DSN=mysql1;UID=jim;PWD=123" student out.txt -v -f"HDR=Off"

And the out.txt contains the exact data from the table student.
