NISQL (short for Non Interactive SQL) is a tool designed to be used in a scheduled environment. It allows user to connect through ODBC to any database, execute any SQL script, and dump the resultset or multiple resultsets into the file(s).

The NISQL is written in OS and RDBMS independent way, so it can be used in any environment.
