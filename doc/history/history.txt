## The Origin

   The nisql was born as a class project for class "COMS 4995 W DESIGN
USING C++". In Spring of 2018, Columbia University.

   At the time of nisql's inception, I already had another tool `export2csv`
which was written in C and had ability to export to CSV format only. It was
used for several years and proved very convenient. So then Professor gave an
assignment "something good in C++", I immediately jumped with a proposal to
expand on `export2csv` and make a similar tools but with multiple output
formats.

   Students were requested to keep a diary on project progression, so we
have it.

   And after a few years of actual use and several years of dormancy (no
direct database usage on a new job) I decided to publish the project to
public. So the oficial history begins now:

## v 1.0
Ready for public use.
