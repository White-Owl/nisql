------------- Day 05
 Well... Despite of the title "Day 5" it was several weeks.

 The support for other options for TXT was written without a single problem.

 The testing of multi-set printout did pose some strange and unexpected problem
that MySQL used as main RDBMS at that point, does not provide multi-set results
by default. It took a few hours of documentation searching and googling various
keywords to find a magical "OPTION=67108864" which have to be used in ODBC
connection string for MySQL to be able to work with multiple select scripts.

 And then support for other formats was supposed to be written by other team
members...
 In the meantime, adding Documentation and Tutorial on github wiki. Not really
a challenge, but an extremely time consuming task.

 And finally it was done! Some minor tweaks for JSON, a big rewrite for XML,
mild rewrite for CSV. But in the end, the version 1.0 is ready for user
testing.

 Time to format the Presentation and convert wiki documents into PDF for
submission.
